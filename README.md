# DATA TYPES AND VARIABLES
int,str,bool,float

# COLLECTIONS
  1)List  - ordered,mutable(It can be changed after created)
  2)Tuple - ordered, immutable(cant be changed after created)
  3)set   - unordered,
  4)Dict  - key-value pairs

# LOOPS AND CONDITION
  1) if/elif/else  - runs on condition, if condition is false, it skips and goes to the next condition.
  2) for loop      - repeat a block of code for each item or range
  3) while loop    - repeats while the condition true
     *break         - stops the loop
     continue      - skip the current iteration*
     
# ARRAYS AND STRINGS
  Array is a collection of elements, stored in continuous memory locations of SAME DATA TYPE   (fast in memory, easy to access with index)
               DIFFERENCE BETWEEN LIST AND ARRAY
                 1) data type    -  can store mixed data type      |      stores only same type 
                 2)
